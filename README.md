## Description

The Workday Calendar challenge tested our JavaScript and third-party API capabilities. The goal was to produce a to-do list, using some existing code, that would change colors to reflect whether a given hour was in the past, present, or future. To-do items were to be stored locally for recall so that one could return at any point throughout the day and see what was left to do

## Installation

N/A

## Challenges

With this challenge I was once again faced with the fact that comprehending JavaScript in theory is very different from applying it practically. I successfully installed the dayjs, and got my click events working, targeted to each individual button, so that the button click applied only to the line on which the button was located. I am able to store those values locally, but I am currently unable to retrieve them.

I spent several hours trying to isolate the calendar hour ids so that I could compare them to the time on the dayjs and change the colors. Ultimately I was not successful in making this work. I would have spent more time, but I have to move on to other projects.
